# SWAN

*:star: Please star this project if you find it useful!*

SWAN stands for Stuff We All Need

Repeating code and reinventing the wheel is generally considered bad practice. At Unosquare we are committed to beautiful code and great software. 
SWAN is a collection of classes and extension methods that we and other good developers have developed and evolved over the years. We found ourselves copying and pasting 
the same code for every project every time we started it. We decide to kill that Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V cycle once and for all. This is the result of that idea.

Our philosophy is that SWAN should have no external dependencies, it should be cross-platform, and it should be useful.
